Regex Tutorial: Understanding Regular Expressions
Introduction
Welcome to the Regex Tutorial! In this tutorial, we'll delve into the world of regular expressions, commonly known as regex. Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching in text data. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of regular expressions by breaking down each component and explaining its functionality.

Summary
The featured regular expression in this tutorial is /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/. This regex is used to match email addresses, ensuring they follow a specific pattern.

Anchors
Anchors such as ^ and $ are used to match the beginning and end of a line respectively.

Quantifiers
Quantifiers like *, +, and ? specify how many times a character or group can appear in the text.

OR Operator
The OR operator | allows you to match one of multiple patterns.

Character Classes
Character classes such as [a-z] define a set of characters that can match at a specific position.

Flags
Flags like g, i, and m modify the behavior of the regex pattern matching.

Grouping and Capturing
Parentheses ( ) are used for grouping and capturing parts of the regex pattern.

Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions [ ] define a set of characters that can match at a specific position.

Greedy and Lazy Match
Quantifiers can be greedy or lazy, determining whether they match as much or as little of the string as possible.

Boundaries
Boundary assertions like \b and \B define positions in the text where certain conditions must be met for a match.

Back-references
Back-references allow you to refer back to previously captured groups within the same pattern.

Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions assert whether a certain pattern is (or is not) followed or preceded by another pattern.
